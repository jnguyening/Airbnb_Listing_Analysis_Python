# Airbnb Listing Data Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data processing pipeline for a massive Airbnb dataset containing over 270,000 listings across major global cities. Using Python and the Pandas library, the analysis focuses on transforming raw, multi-dimensional data into actionable market intelligence.

The project is structured to demonstrate a professional data science workflow, beginning with the ingestion of large-scale CSV files using optimized memory management and specific character encoding. A significant portion of the work involves data sanitization and feature engineering, specifically isolating the Paris market to evaluate local neighborhood performance, host tenure, and pricing dynamics.

This project involves **data analysis** of Paris Airbnb listing data using Python. The dataset, available from [Maven Analytics Data Playground](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=airbnb), contains detailed information on Airbnb listings, including prices, locations, property types, and availability. The workflow includes cleaning and preprocessing the data, followed by exploratory analysis to uncover insights about pricing trends, popular neighborhoods, and listing characteristics. This project showcases how Python can be used to analyze real-world hospitality data to inform market strategies and customer preferences.
