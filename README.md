# Airbnb Listing Data Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data processing pipeline for a massive Airbnb dataset containing over 270,000 listings across major global cities. Using Python and the Pandas library, the analysis focuses on transforming raw, multi-dimensional data into actionable market intelligence.

The project is structured to demonstrate a professional data science workflow, beginning with the ingestion of large-scale CSV files using optimized memory management and specific character encoding. A significant portion of the work involves data sanitization and feature engineering, specifically isolating the Paris market to evaluate local neighborhood performance, host tenure, and pricing dynamics.
